### Configure APICTL tool for API Operator

- Download [API controller v3.2.0](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim-tooling/releases/tag/v3.2.0).

- Extract the API controller distribution, and navigate inside the extracted folder using the command-line tool

- Add the location of the extracted folder to your system's $PATH variable to be able to access the executable from anywhere.

- You can find available operations using the below command.
    ```sh
    >> apictl --help
    ```
- This tool comes with the kubectl commands.
- However, by default API controller has disabled kubectl command. 
- When you are working with the API Operator, set the API Controllerâ€™s ***mode*** to Kubernetes as mentioned below.
    
    ```sh
    >> apictl set --mode k8s 
    ```
  
- If you wish to switch back to default mode, use the following command
    ```sh
    >> apictl set --mode default
    ```
